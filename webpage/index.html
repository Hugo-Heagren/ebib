<center><h1>Ebib</h1></center>

<p>Ebib is a program with which you can manage BibTeX databases. There are
already quite a few such programs, but Ebib has a special property: it runs
inside Emacs. If you are used to doing everything (La)TeX from within
Emacs, you may appreciate that you can manage your <tt>.bib</tt> files in
Emacs as well. One distinct advantage of Ebib is that you do not need to
switch to another window and copy/paste a BibTeX key into your LaTeX file
with the mouse. Ebib provides a function with which you can select a key
from the database by using tab-completion and have it inserted directly
into your LaTeX text.</p>

<p>Ebib is fully keyboad-operated. Unlike other BibTeX database managers,
you do not need the mouse at all. Everything Ebib can do can be
accomplished with simple one-key commands. This makes using Ebib much
faster than other similar programs, which are usually mouse-operated. And
because Emacs does not have to run under X, Ebib as well can be used
without X.</p>

<p>Ebib provides the standard capabilities that one would expect from a
BibTeX database manager: <tt>.bib</tt> files can be opened, modified
(adding, deleting, modifying entries), searched, and saved. Obviously, it
is also possible to start a new database from scratch. A nice property is
the ability to copy single entries to another <tt>.bib</tt> file: this
makes it possible to create a new <tt>.bib</tt> file from a subset of the
entries of an existing database. This can be useful e.g. when you want to
create a <tt>.bib</tt> file for a paper containing only the works cited in
that paper.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li> runs in GNU Emacs and XEmacs.</li>

<li> format of the <tt>.bib</tt> file is not restricted: everything that
BibTeX accepts is also accepted by Ebib.</li>

<li> multiple <tt>.bib</tt> files can be opened at the same time: copying
entries from one file to another is possible.</li>

<li> visual representation distinguishing obligatory, optional and
additional fields.</li>

<li> complex search queries with logical <tt>and, or</tt> and <tt>not</tt>
operators, built up interactively, can be performed on a database.</li>

<li> creating and editing <tt>@string</tt> and <tt>@preamble</tt>
definitions is supported.</li>

<li> BibTeX entry and field types can be customised, allowing adaptation
for non-standard and personal bibliography styles.</li>

<li> field values containing newlines are supported, allowing the creation
of annotated bibliographies.</li>

<li> merging of a second <tt>.bib</tt> file with an already loaded
database.</li>

<li> single entries can be exported to another file, allowing the creation
of a new specialised <tt>.bib</tt> file from an existing
one. <tt>@preamble</tt> and <tt>@string</tt> definitions can also be
exported.</li>

<li> optionally sorting the entries in the <tt>.bib</tt> file on
user-specified fields when saving the database.</li>

<li> optionally saving the database with all entries with a crossref field
  at the top of the <tt>.bib</tt> file. (This is not compatible with
  sorting the entries in the <tt>.bib</tt> file.)</li>

<li> automatic creation of a LaTeX document of selected entries for
printing.</li>

<li> copy/cut/paste mechanism for quickly copying field values. (This fully
integrates with Emacs' kill ring.)</li>

<li> automatic insertion of a BibTeX key into a (La)TeX document, where the
user can use tab completion to select a key from the database.</li>

<li> automatic loading of <tt>.bib</tt> files upon startup.</li>

<li> on-line help function summarising the available commands.</li>

<li> extensive user manual.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Screenshots</h2>

<a name="screenshots">

</a><p><a name="screenshots">Visually, Ebib is not very spectacular. But to
get an idea what it looks like, you can take a look at the following two
screenshots. The first shows Ebib's standard lay-out, with the list of
entry keys in the top window and the fields of the currently highlighted
entry in the bottom window. The string `McCarthy' is highlighted as the
result of a text search:

<p>The second screen shot shows the strings buffer, where you can edit
  the <tt>@string</tt> definitions in the database:
